Why React?
- react allow us to write composable code
- it is like sculping a scripture
- or like using legos to build a huge lego sculpture
- An live example is: for a navigation bar on any website, it could be a very long piece of code. and that is just one navigation bar. There are 
    plenty of items within a web page itself and if we include everything in an html, it will be pagessssss long
- That is where react, a morden framework comes in which introduces the concept of component, where we can put items in components. 
    ie  - navigation bar component
        - search bar component
        - header component
- Thereafter, putting all these components together to make something that is larger, building into the sculpture
- more maintainable and more flexible

Another reason why ppl like React => Declarative
- opposite of declarative = imperative
- Declarative = what should be done = tell me what to do and i will worry how to do
- Imperative = how should it be done = describe to me step by step on how to do it and i will do it


Why we have a HTML in javascript REactDOM.render() function
- jsx = flavour of js which looks alot like html
- intro of jsx to react => makes react become more declarative instead of imperative
- With ReactDOM.render()
- with jsx, we can write the usual HTML
